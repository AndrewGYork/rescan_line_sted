# Line-rescanned STED microscopy is gentler and faster than point-descanned STED microscopy

A scientific publication, describing a way to improve microscopy. This repository hosts everything you need to reproduce our results. Read the publication here:
https://calico.github.io/rescan_line_sted (hosted via the Calico Labs institutional GitHub account)
or here:

This repository is intended to hold a (mostly) self-contained scientific publication. It contains:

* HTML, javascript, CSS, and small images (`index.html`, `appendix.html`, and the `javascript`, `stylesheets`, and `images` directories)
* A (limited) PDF version of the publication; note that this does not include animated/interactive figures.
* Code which produces figures (in the `figure_code` directory). You can run and modify this code to verify and explore my results. See `figure_code/README.md` for instructions how to run the figure generation code.

Some files aren't suitable for version control, (e.g. raw data, large numbers of pre-rendered figure images, etc). These are stored in a sister repository:

https://github.com/AndrewGYork/rescan_line_sted_data

Hopefully this makes it easier to manage big, non-text files without risking the faithful version control of small, important text-based files stored here.
