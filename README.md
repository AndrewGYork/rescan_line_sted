# rescan_line_sted
Scripts used to generate the data in the rescan line-sted manuscript.

If you want to run the code, you'll need a python 3 environment, and also the python subpackages [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/), and [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/). [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) satisfies these requirements with a single installation.

Also, download [np_tif.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewGYork/tools/master/np_tif.py), and put it in the same directory as the other scripts.
