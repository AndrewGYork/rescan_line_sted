# rescan_line_sted
Scripts used to generate the data in the rescan line-sted manuscript. One script for each data figure: `line_sted_figure_1.py`, `line_sted_figure_2.py`, `line_sted_figure_3.py`; run these scripts to generate the corresponding data. They take a while and print a lot of gibberish to screen; their useful output is saved to disk in a subfolder. Figure 4 is an illustration, so it has no associated script.

If you want to run the code, you'll need a python 3 environment, and also the python subpackages [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/), and [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/). [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) satisfies these requirements with a single installation.

Put all the files in this repository in the same folder on your local machine. `np_tif.py` and `line_sted_tools.py` are utility scripts that the other scripts depend on; do not run these scripts individually. `test_object_astronaut.tif`, `test_object_cat.tif`, `test_object_lines.tif` and `test_object_rings.tif` are images of resolution targets used by the figure-generating scripts. You can open them in [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) if you want to inspect them.
